# Baba!
Attempt to make one's hand card shaffling system in BabaArashi  
BabaArashi(babaÂµê in Japanese) is a card game which is almost same to the Japanese card game calld "Daifugo"(Refer [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daifug%C5%8D) for rules)  

This system is super simple.  
BabaServer calculate who exchanges one's card to whom, when BabaClient send a packet after a button is pushed with it.  
That's all.  
Nothing more, nothing less.  

# BabaServer
Usual state  
Who exchanges whom is written  
You can see the clock, too. Nice!

After receving a packet...

After 5 seconds (or several seconds) return to usual state.

XBee must be connected to the computer which runs BabaServer program.

# BabaClient

## Schematic 1: XBee x Arduino Fio v3 x Li-Po battery x LEGO
Connect XBee, Arduino Fio v3, Li-Po battery, and button  
Then put it into the cabinet made with LEGO

### XBee setting
Some property must be changed to do IO detecting and communicating.  
Set Distination address. (Notice!! PAN ID must be same to the XBee Coodinator)
